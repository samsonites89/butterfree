flutter tryouts

## introduction (WIP)

`flutter` itself is a framework that uses the language `dart` (made by google). One of the main advantages of `flutter` is that there is a single source code that can be used to crate applications on various platforms and OS.


## how to get setup with flutter (WIP)

I am using a mac, so mine will mostly be based on how to set it up as mac.
`flutter` can be used to build many type of apps, but as the recommendation is `ios`, I will follwo guide for iOS apps.

I am following the official guide from flutter page here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-ios
